Link Shrinker
=============

Basecamp can't cope with URLs that have unbreakable content in the query string. Such URLs destroy the page layout, which makes me sad.

See http://effectif.com/projects/basecamp-link-shrinker for an example.

This Safari extension fixes the layout by modifying the anchor text of long links. Place your mouse cursor over such links in order to see the full URL in a tooltip.
